# Learn-Data-Mining
I use this repository as a learning platform about data mining

This repository is a learning platform for data mining using Python.

## Raw Dataset

Iris Dataset (from Kaggle):  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris

## Project Overview

The project aims to classify iris flower species using a Decision Tree classifier based on four flower features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Insight & Findings

- The model achieved an accuracy of 97.7%
- Confusion Matrix shows very few misclassifications
- Petal width and petal length are the most influential features

## AI Support Explanation

This project was supported by IBM Granite, a large language model (LLM) that helped:

- Suggest the suitable classification method
- Provide explanations for metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Guide the documentation process in markdown format
